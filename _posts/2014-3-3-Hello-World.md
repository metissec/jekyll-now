The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
More on these type of attacks.

I surprised at how easy this attack was, it seemed like a basic web hacking challenge. But then I considered that this
is a common theme with router web interfaces, poor security. I don't think the impact is huge in this case but it
demonstrates a couple of larger security issues. One being that router security is often full of security holes
especially with web interfaces, default passwords, and improper implementations of security features. Two since these
interfaces are rarely explored in depth except for setup and maintenance or admins choose consoles over interfaces, that security holes can be easily overlooked. These issues are also magnified with products that don't have a large
market share.

I would just like to say the vendor, Virtual Access, was very quick with a response to the issue. Also would like to
thank the team at US-CERT in helping me disclose the vulnerability in a efficient and ethical manner.
