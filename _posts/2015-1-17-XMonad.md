Xmonad is a haskell based X11 windows manager(wm). It is a tiling wm, although is does have the ability for floating windows. This, in a nutshell, means that there is no wasted space and most window controls are through the keyboard. This offers many benefits that others have written a lot about therefore I will not be discussing.   I am deploying this windows manager on a “standard” arch install with no desktop environment (do have xfce4 installed for back-up but I don’t use it), on my chromebook Acer C720 with custom firmware.

The config for Xmonad put simply is time consuming and at time frustrating but it is very rewarding and educational. Also once it works, it works right and constially. Also the community for Xmonad is great much, very similar to larger haskell community. Now is haskell needed to use this wm, short answer no. But I would not recommend it if you don’t have some interest in learning it or knowing it. Haskell has been my most recent programming language I am learning so I thought it would be a nice fit for my wm to be using nothing but haskell.
